# Trin

Trin is a Rust implementation of a [Portal Network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) client.

The Portal Network is still in the research phase, so understand that this client is experimental.

## How to use Trin

Check out the [Getting Started](/docs/getting_started.md) guide to quickly get up and running with Trin.

## Experimental Status

Trin is a prototype Portal Network client. This implementation and the Portal Network specificiation will continue to co-evolve.

In this stage of development, Trin relies on Infura to respond to some requests that it cannot fulfill itself. Additionally, Trin lacks comprehensive data validation.

Do not rely on Trin in a production setting.
