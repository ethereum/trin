# Trin

Trin is a Rust implementation of a [Portal Network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) client.

The Portal Network is still in the research phase, and this client is experimental.

**Do not rely on Trin in a production setting.**

**NOTE: Unix-only**

Trin currently only runs on Unix-based platforms (Linux, macOS). We plan to eventually implement support for Windows, but until then do not expect any support for issues on Windows.

## How to use Trin

Check out the [Trin book](https://ethereum.github.io/trin) to quickly get up and running with Trin.

> **NOTE**: This project uses [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). If you just cloned the project, be sure to run: `git submodule update --init`. See our dedicated [page](https://ethereum.github.io/trin/developers/contributing/git/submodules.html) for more info.

## Experimental Status

Trin is a prototype Portal Network client. This implementation and the Portal Network specifications will continue to co-evolve.

In this stage of development, Trin lacks comprehensive data validation.
