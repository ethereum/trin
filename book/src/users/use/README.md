# Querying Data

Once Trin is running, you can access Ethereum data by making requests to its endpoint.

The interface for these requests is JSON-RPC, which is a standard way to communicate with Ethereum nodes.

In the following sections, we make queries with:
- hand-coded JSON-RPC
- using a Web3 library

Serving data for wallets is not covered here. We hope to get there eventually, but the network is not ready quite yet.
