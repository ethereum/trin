# Comments

Any datatype of significance **should** have an accompanying comment briefly describing its role and responsibilities. Comments are an extremely valuable tool in open-source projects with many different contributors, and can greatly improve development speed. Explain your assumptions clearly so others don't need to dig through the code.
- Rust [doc comments](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/meta/doc.html) are the most best way to comment your code.
