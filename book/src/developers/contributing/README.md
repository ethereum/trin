# Contributor guidelines

These guidelines are heavily influenced by the [Snake-Charmer Tactical Manual](https://github.com/ethereum/snake-charmers-tactical-manual). While the manual is written with a focus on Python projects, there is tons of relevant information in there for how to effectively contribute to open-source projects, and it's recommended that you look through the manual before contributing.
