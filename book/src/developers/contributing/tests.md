# Tests

Testing is essential to the production of software with minimal flaws. The default should always be writing tests for the code you produce.

Testing also introduces overhead into our workflow. If a test suite takes a long time to run, it slows down our iteration cycle. This means finding a pragmatic balance between thorough testing, and the speed of our test suite, as well as always iterating on our testing infrastructure.

Unit test names should unambiguously identify the functionality being tested. Omit any "test" prefix from the name to avoid redundancy.
