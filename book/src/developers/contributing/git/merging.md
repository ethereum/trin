# Merging

Once your pull request has been *Approved* it may be merged at your discretion.  In most cases responsibility for merging is left to the person who opened the pull request, however for simple pull requests it is fine for anyone to merge.

If substantive changes are made **after** the pull request has been marked *Approved* you should ask for an additional round of review.
