This part of the book is for understanding Trin, and processes around
building Trin better.

Where the Trin crates and the Portal Network specification are the source of
truth, this section seeks to offer a quicker "key concepts" for getting started.

It seeks to answer questions like:
- What do I need to know about the Portal Network?
- How do the different components of Trin work together?
- What sort of data guarantees are made and how are they achieved?
- What things should a new contributor be mindful of?
