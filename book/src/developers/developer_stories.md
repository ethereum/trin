# Developer stories

Trin is under active development. Perhaps you would like to get involved?

The following are some situations that might resonate.

## Issue resolver

Someone who tried out Trin and found an issue, then worked out
where it was coming from.

Consider making a pull request to fix the issue.

## Ecosystem contributor

Trin, and the Portal Network more broadly are perhaps more
quiet than other areas of Ethereum development. Maybe you can see
yourself helping out somewhere where you can have a meaningful impact.

## Researcher

Someone looking into the Ethereum protocol upgrade path, and thinking through
the impact of potential upcoming changes.

There are interesting facets to the Portal network still to be determined.

Perhaps you can be tempted by:
- Double batched merkle log accumulators
- Topology of content in distributed hash tables
- Adversarial scenario planning and mitigation

## Hobbyist

Someone looking to poke around and run a node on a single board computer or
a mobile device. How small is too small?

## Rust developer

Someone looking to build something meaningful in Rust, with interesting
architecture and crates:
- Cryptography
- Peer to peer networking
- Async runtimes
