# Bridge

Blocks are produced by Ethereum Execution clients which use a different
network to Portal Network nodes. A Bridge node is responsible for taking data
from the external network and passing it to the Portal Network.

    eth[Ethereum Execution node]-->bridge[Portal Network Bridge node]

```
This operates as follows:

    Bridge-->>Execution: eth_getBlock
    Execution-->>Bridge: block
    Bridge-->>Portal: block
```
Currently the bridge functionality exists as a separate executable under `portal-bridge`.
