# Progress status

The Portal Network and Trin are under active development so different components
may be in varying stages of progress.

- Completed, looking for bugs
- Mid-construction
- Future, planned features

Some methods to get a sense of the state of development are:
- Run `trin -- --help` and see what flags are available.
- Look at recent closed PRs to see what has just been merged.
- Look at recent issues that have been opened to see what active foci are.
- Look at what examples are shown in the setup and usage guides.
- Run trin in the way you think it might work and see what happens.
